            You should not rely solely on the TBI software application(s) for determining the performance of an
            insulation system and/or the energy or cost saving potential. The TBI software applications allow you to
            quickly check the performance of an insulation system and the energy or cost saving potential roughly,
            due to the influence of a number of factors, including data/input provided by the user. The software
            applications are not meant to replace professional advice. Under no circumstance EiiF and/or any EiiF
            member authorized to use the member version of the Software application will be liable for damages
            occurring to persons and properties of any nature and/or any other damages or losses arising out of the
            use of the TBI software application(s) or any information or service obtained through it, including direct,
            indirect, consequential or incidental damages and losses.
