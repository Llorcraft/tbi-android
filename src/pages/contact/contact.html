  <p>This document (together with the documents referred to in it) tells you the terms of use of the TBI
    (Tipcheck Based Inspections) software application. Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using
    the Software application. By using the Software application, you agree to be bound by these Terms of
    Use.</p>

        <li>
          The TBI (Easy/Pro) app is an easy-to-use insulation self-inspection and reporting application for tablets
          and smartphones (Android/iOS). The Software application is intended to be used as an aid for the User
          to quickly check and report the performance of an insulation system and to roughly determine how much
          energy or cost saving potential an existing technical insulation system has to offer. The TBI-
          Administrator application is a windows based software and administration tool for administering the
          projects collected with the TBI (Easy/Pro) app.
        </li>
        <li>
          The calculated estimations are based on basic and simplified heat transfer formulas (e.g. always using
          0m/s wind speed and horizontal as the orientation of the system) and generic values, typical for
          standard insulation solutions. The User is exclusively responsible for the correctness of the input of data
          into the Software application. You must be are aware that theoretical values can deviate from those
          occurring in practice and that, therefore, the estimated results fully depend on the accuracy of the
          inserted information like diameter, surface temperature, ambient temperature, etc. We do not provide
          or recommend any specific technical solution nor insulation material.
        </li>
        <li>
          YOU SHOULD NOT RELY SOLELY ON THE SOFTWARE APPLICATION FOR DETERMINING THE
          PERFORMANCE OF AN INSULATION SYSTEM AND/OR THE ENERGY OR COST SAVING POTENTIAL. THE
          SOFTWARE APPLICATION ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO DETERMINE THE PERFORMANCE OF AN INSULATION
          SYSTEM AND/OR THE ENERGY OR COST SAVING POTENTIAL ROUGHLY, DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF A
          NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING DATA/INPUT PROVIDED BY THE USER. THE SOFTWARE APPLICATION
          IS NOT MEANT TO REPLACE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.
        </li>
        <li>
          You acknowledge that you are aware and agree that under no circumstance EiiF will be held liable for
          damages occurring to persons and properties of any nature and/or any other damages or losses arising
          out of the use of the Software application or any information or Service obtained through it, including
          direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damages and losses.
